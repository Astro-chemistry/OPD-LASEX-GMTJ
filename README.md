# OPD-LASEX-GMTJ Tools

Welcome to the repository for tools developed by the **LASEX/OV** group during observations at the Observatório do Pico dos Dias (OPD), specifically for the **SPARC4** instrument on the 1.6m telescope.  
This repository is intended to assist current and future observers in efficiently planning, selecting, and analyzing extragalactic targets.

## About LASEX/OV

Extragalactic Astrophysics is one of the most active fields in contemporary Astronomy, and at the Valongo Observatory we created the **LASEX** (Laboratório de Astrofísica Extragaláctica) group in 2013 to foster collaboration among students, postdocs, and faculty.  
We work observationally across almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum — from radio to X-ray — and our research covers galaxy formation, evolution, and the role of dark matter, among other key topics.

LASEX researchers are actively involved in projects at major observatories like Keck, VLT/ESO, and ALMA.

## About SPARC4

**SPARC4** (Simultaneous Polarimeter and Rapid Camera in 4 bands) is a new instrument installed on the 1.6m telescope at OPD, developed through a collaboration between INPE and LNA.  
Since its first light in 2022, SPARC4 has been successfully commissioned and is now fully operational, offering simultaneous imaging in four optical bands (**griz**) and polarimetry capabilities.  
A full data reduction pipeline in Python is available, and the instrument is now an official facility of OPD starting from semester **2024A**.

## Project Science Focus

Our observing program focuses on studying **50 Milky Way analog galaxies** to better understand the distribution of **dark matter** in galaxies similar to our own.  
By combining SPARC4's multi-band imaging with deep infrared data, we perform detailed stellar population analyses to decompose rotation curves and isolate the dark matter contribution.

## Available Tools

We currently provide **three Jupyter Notebooks**, each designed to streamline a specific part of the observing and data preparation workflow:

| Notebook | Purpose | Link |
|:---------|:--------|:-----|
| **Finders** | Generate finder charts for galaxies to preview morphology and size before observations. | [Finders.ipynb](./Finders.ipynb) |
| **OPDsample** | Filter and select galaxies for the sample, excluding targets already observed in previous cycles. | [OPDsample.ipynb](./OPDsample.ipynb) |
| **Counts** | Calculate the exposure time needed to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ("contagem") for each target. It needs to be no less than 20% of 60000 maximum at OPD (i.e. 24000) and no more than 60% of this value (36000). The closer to 36000 counts you get, the better signal-to-noise you achieve. | [Counts.ipynb](./Counts.ipynb) |

## Additional Resources

In addition to the notebooks, we provide supporting documents:

| Resource | Description | Link |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|
| **S4G Galaxy List** | The list of galaxies from the S4G survey, used in the Finders tool. | [S4G_1.csv](./S4G_1.csv) |
| **Example Spreadsheet** | A template to guide users in structuring their own target lists for observations. | [![Download Spreadsheet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Spreadsheet-blue?logo=microsoft-excel)](./Example%20Spreadsheet.csv)
| **Written Tutorial** | Tutorial collaboratively developed by the group, with final writing and formatting done by **Maria Clara**. | [SPARC4 Tutorial (PDF)](./Tutorial___SPARC4.pdf) |
